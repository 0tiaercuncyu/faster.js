# Concrete Bridge Practice by V.K. Raina: A Comprehensive Guide for Bridge Engineers
  
Bridge engineering is a complex and challenging field that requires a thorough understanding of structural analysis, design, construction, maintenance and economics. Bridge engineers need to consider various factors such as site conditions, traffic loads, environmental impacts, aesthetics, safety and durability when designing and building bridges.

One of the most widely used materials for bridge construction is concrete, which offers many advantages such as high strength, low maintenance, fire resistance and versatility. However, concrete bridges also pose some challenges such as cracking, corrosion, fatigue and seismic vulnerability. Therefore, concrete bridge practice requires a sound knowledge of the material properties, behaviour and performance of concrete under various conditions.
  
A valuable resource for bridge engineers who want to learn more about concrete bridge practice is the book "Concrete Bridge Practice by V.K. Raina". This book covers the analysis, design and economics of concrete bridges in a comprehensive and systematic manner. It provides both theoretical and practical aspects of concrete bridge practice, with numerous examples, illustrations, tables and charts. It also discusses the latest developments and innovations in concrete bridge technology, such as prestressed concrete, composite construction, segmental construction and cable-stayed bridges.
  
The book is divided into four parts: Part I deals with the general principles of bridge engineering, such as bridge types, loads, codes and specifications; Part II covers the analysis of concrete bridges, such as elastic theory, plastic theory, ultimate load method and limit state method; Part III focuses on the design of concrete bridges, such as reinforced concrete bridges, prestressed concrete bridges, composite bridges and special bridges; Part IV discusses the economics of concrete bridges, such as cost estimation, optimization and life cycle analysis.
  
The book is written by Dr. V.K. Raina, who is a renowned bridge engineer with over 40 years of experience in teaching, research and consultancy. He has authored several books and papers on bridge engineering and has received many awards and honors for his contributions to the field. He is also a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers (London) and a member of several professional bodies.
  
"Concrete Bridge Practice by V.K. Raina" is a must-read for bridge engineers who want to enhance their knowledge and skills in concrete bridge practice. It is also a useful reference for students, teachers, researchers and consultants who are interested in bridge engineering. The book is available in PDF format online from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

To illustrate the application of concrete bridge practice, here are some examples of concrete bridge design from different countries and contexts:
  
- The Confederation Bridge in Canada is the world's longest bridge over ice-covered water, spanning 12.9 km across the Northumberland Strait. It is a prestressed concrete box girder bridge with 44 piers and a main span of 250 m. It was designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as ice loading, wind loading and seismic loading. It was completed in 1997 and cost about $1 billion CAD.
- The Millau Viaduct in France is the world's tallest bridge, with a maximum height of 343 m above the valley floor. It is a cable-stayed bridge with seven concrete piers and a steel deck. It has a total length of 2.46 km and a main span of 342 m. It was designed to blend with the natural landscape and to minimize the impact on the environment. It was completed in 2004 and cost about â¬400 million EUR.
- The Bandra-Worli Sea Link in India is the first cable-stayed bridge in Mumbai, connecting the western suburbs with the central business district. It is a prestressed concrete bridge with two cable-stayed sections and a viaduct section. It has a total length of 5.6 km and a main span of 250 m. It was designed to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in the city and to enhance the coastal scenery. It was completed in 2009 and cost about â¹16 billion INR.

These examples show the diversity and creativity of concrete bridge practice around the world. They also demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of concrete bridges for various purposes and situations.
